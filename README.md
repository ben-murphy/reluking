# Re-LuKing at Neural Nets
This repository is an exploration into potential neural net improvements based on new discoveries in the world of neuroscience. Using ReLu functions in different places in the network, we tried to design a neural net that was more accurate to the neurons that were found in nature. We also attempted to replicate natureâ€™s neurons by using AdaBoost with neural networks instead of with decision trees.

## File Breakdown

### FinalWriteUp.pdf
This is the final write up of the projects findings. It contains graphs and images that flesh out the process and the end result of the project.

### FinalWriteUp.tex

This contains the Latex code for FinalWriteUp.pdf.

### loadmnist.py

This contains the python code for loading the mnist dataset into the Neural Network so that it could be trained on. This requires that you have the MNSIT dataset already downloaded.

### nn_from_scratch.py
This contains the actual Neural Net that would run the various required computations. Warning, this is rather computationally intensive and I don't recommend running it on a single workstation.
